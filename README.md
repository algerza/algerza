### Hi there 👋

I am passionate about problem solving through data, making sure my solutions have a real impact on the business. Some key projects I worked on:
- **Predictive Lead Scoring Model** - 🛒Predict and rank customers leads based on their behavior - Who wil convert? Who will not? Why?
- **Time-series forecasting** - 📈 Predict how many sales the online store will get
- **Retail Store Clustering** - 🛍️ Segmentation of different retail stores to determine what are the strategic ones to keep in the real estate portfolio
- **60 Years of summer hits analysis** - 🎸 Data analysis on how music has changed over the last 60 years using Spotify data 
- **Covid-10 impact in Latvia** - 🦠 Data story about how Covid 19 is affecting Latvia compared to the rest of the world
